# LMS Hibernate JPA
The objective of this project was to implement Object Relational Mapping into the Library Management System Application that was written in Spring. I used Hibernate JPA to replace all the basic CRUD operation code. As I implemented this method of ORM, I learned how to annotate my entities to map them directly to the tables in my database and which CRUD operation methods to use based on the request method.
